QuickDB
==================

A Simple Document Database Any One Can Use Instantly At Any Point In Your Development



I am doing this because i wanted something really really really simple to setup/use/deploy etc and use even in the middle of any project. Even better, something where I dont need to do anything! And yet get some reasonable persistence integrities, securities as well as other capabilities not excluding the goodies of unit and integration testing. Those are the goals of the project

I am hoping this will add some value to anyone that like things easy.
